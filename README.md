# 📱 iPhone Purchase Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a person will purchase an iPhone based on independent variables such as gender, age, and salary, with the dependent variable being the iPhone purchase decision. The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline that includes loading the dataset, Preprocessing the dataset, training various models, and evaluating their performance. To achieve accurate and reliable results, different types of machine learning algorithms will be applied, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). Through this approach, the project seeks to determine the most effective model for predicting consumer behavior in relation to iPhone purchases
